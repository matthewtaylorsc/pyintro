# Task 2.:  Write a Python function isPalindrome that checks whether a passed string is palindrome or not.
# Note: A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward,
# e.g., madam or nurses run.



isPalindrome("Red rum, sir, is murder")

# Task 3.: Write a function called fizz_buzz that takes a number.
# - If the number is divisible by 3, it should return “Fizz”.
# - If it is divisible by 5, it should return “Buzz”.
# - If it is divisible by both 3 and 5, it should return “FizzBuzz”.
# - Otherwise, it should return the same number.

# Task 4.: Audi Tor, an accountant at ErnstCoopers, has been asked to do an audit
# of invoices with each having a document ID. Write a function which
# accepts 2 parameters - a list of document IDs and number X of samples you
# want from the list. Return a list of X random (.rand) document IDs.
